<p>Software development is a young profession, and we are still learning the
      techniques and building the tools to do it effectively. I've been involved
      in this activity for over three decades and in the last two I've been
      writing on this website about patterns and practices that make it easier to build useful
      software. The site began as a place to put my own writing, but
      I also use it to publish articles by my colleagues.</p>

<p>In 2000, I joined <a class = 'highlight' href = 'https://thoughtworks.com'>Thoughtworks</a>, where my role
      is to learn about the techniques that we've learned to deliver software
      for our clients, and pass these techniques on to the wider software
      industry. As this site has developed into a respected platform on software
      development, I've edited and published articles by my colleagues, both ThoughtWorkers
      and others, to help useful writing reach a wider audience.</p>

<h1>A website on building software effectively</h1>

<p>If there's a theme that runs through my work and writing on this site,
        it's the interplay between the shift towards agile thinking and the
        technical patterns and practices that make agile software development
        practical. While specifics of technology change rapidly in our
        profession, fundamental practices and patterns are more stable. So
        writing about these allows me to have articles on this site that are
        several years old but still as relevant as when they were written.</p>

<p>As software becomes more critical to modern business, software needs to
        be able to react quickly to changes, allowing new features to be be
        conceived, developed and put into production rapidly. The techniques of
        <a class = 'highlight' href = '/agile.html'>agile software development</a> began in the 1990s
        and became steadily more popular in the last decade. They focus on a
        flexible approach to planning, which allows software products to change
        direction as the users' needs change and as product managers learn more
        about how to make their users effective. While widely accepted now, agile
        approaches are not easy, requiring significant skills for a team, but more
        importantly a culture of open collaboration both within the team and with a
        team's partners.</p>

<p>This need to respond fluently to changes has an important impact upon
        the <a class = 'highlight' href = '/architecture'>architecture</a> of a software system. The
        software needs to be built in such a way that it is able to adapt to
        unexpected changes in features. One of the most important ways to do this
        is to write clear code, making it easy to understand what the program
        is supposed to do. This code should be divided into modules which allow
        developers to understand only the parts of the system they need to make a
        change. This production code should be supported with automated tests that
        can detect any errors made when making a change while providing examples
        of how internal structures are used. Large and complex software efforts
        may find the <a class = 'highlight' href = '/microservices'>microservices</a> architectural style
        helps teams deploy software with less entangling dependencies.</p>

<p>Creating software that has a good architecture isn't something that can
        be done first time. Like good prose, it needs regular revisions as
        programmers learn more about what the product needs to do and how best to
        design the product to achieve its goals. <a class = 'highlight' href = 'https://refactoring.com'>Refactoring</a> is an essential technique to allow a
        program to be changed safely. It consists of making small changes that
        don't alter the observable behavior of the software. By combining lots of
        small changes, developers can revise the software's structure supporting
        significant modifications that weren't planned when the system was first
        conceived.</p>

<p>Software that runs only on a developer's machine isn't providing
        value to the customers of the software. Traditionally releasing software
        has been a long and complicated process, one that hinders the need to
        evolve software quickly. <a class = 'highlight' href = '/delivery.html'>Continuous Delivery</a> uses
        automation and collaborative workflows to remove this bottleneck,
        allowing teams to release software as often as the customers demand. 
        For Continuous Delivery to be possible, we need to build in a solid
        foundation of <a class = 'highlight' href = '/testing'>Testing</a>, with a range of
        automated tests that can give us confidence that our changes haven't
        introduced any bugs. This leads us to integrate testing into
        programming, which can act to improve our architecture.</p>

<h2>Data Management</h2>

<p>There are many kinds of software out there, the kind I'm primarily
          engaged is Enterprise Applications. One of the enduring problems we
          need to tackle in this world is <a class = 'highlight' href = '/data'>data management</a>. The aspects of data
          managment I've focused on here are how to migrate data stores as their
          applications respond to changing needs, coping with different contexts
          across a large enterprise, the role of NoSQL databases, and the
          broader issues of coping with data that is both Big and Messy.</p>

<section class = 'dsl article-card' id = 'Domain-specificLanguages'>
<h2>Domain-Specific Languages</h2>

<p>A common problem in complex software systems is how to capture
          complicated domain logic in a way that programmers can both easily
          manipulate and also easily communicate to domain experts. <a class = 'highlight' href = '/dsl.html'>Domain-Specific Languages</a> (DSLs) create a custom language
          for a particular problem, either with custom parsers or by conventions

           game that fully occupies my mind, clearing out all the serious
          thoughts for a bit, while enjoying the company of good friends. Modern
          board games saw dramatic improvement in the 1990's with the rise of
          Eurogames, and I expect many people would be surprised if they haven't
          tried any of this new generation. I also appear regularly on <a href = '/bliki/HeavyCardboard.html'>Heavy Cardboard</a>.</p>

      advocate. When doing that, I see <a href="/articles/authorial-stance.html">two main stances</a> an author
      can take. One is to focus on the trade-offs between this technique and its
      alternatives, the other is to focus on the merits of the particular
      technique and not discuss the alternatives.</p>

<h2><a href = '/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/revert-to-source.html'>Legacy Displacement: Revert to Source</a></h2>

<p class = 'datetime'>Thu 07 Jul 2022 10:07 EDT</p>

<div class="img-link"><a href="/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/revert-to-source.html"><img src="/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/card.png" width=""></a></div>

<p>Legacy systems often act as integration hubs, ingesting source data to
      pass on to downstream systems. A new downstream system can decouple itself
      from legacy by finding the source of data to the legacy and integrating
      directly to that instead. <b class="author">Ian Cartwright, Rob Horn, and James
      Lewis</b> describe this <a href="/articles/patterns-legacy-displacement/revert-to-source.html">Revert to Source</a> pattern,
      explaining that this part of legacy displacement often also allows a new
      system to take advantage of upgrades to source data that the legacy had neglected.</p>

<h2><a href = '/articles/product-backlog-building-canvas.html'>Product Backlog Building Canvas</a></h2>

<p class = 'datetime'>Tue 14 Jun 2022 10:15 EDT</p>

<div class="img-link"><a href="/articles/product-backlog-building-canvas.html"><img src="/articles/product-backlog-building-canvas/card.png" width=""></a></div>

<p>Many software teams describe desired product capabilities as a product
      backlog: a list of user stories. These stories capture who needs the work,
      what the work is, and why it's needed. Too often teams expect a product
      owner to be the sole source of the backlog, but anyone could (and should)
      write user stories. Paulo Caroli teaches teams to use a <a href="/articles/product-backlog-building-canvas.html">Product Backlog
      Building Canvas</a>, which provides a simple process to develop user stories,
      starting with describing personas for product users and the activities
      they do. These activities yield features: their interactions with the
      product. Features are broken down into backlog items, which can then be
      formulated into user stories from the background of personas and
      activities.</p>

<h2><a href = 'https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/book_club/refactoring'>Agile Book Club interview on Refactoring</a></h2>

<p class = 'datetime'>Thu 28 Apr 2022 11:33 EDT</p>

<p>James Shore's Art of Agile Development is my favorite single-volume
      book on agile software development. A reason for that is its serious
      emphasis on the technical practices that are essential to making it work
      effectively. <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/book_club/refactoring">James and I discuss</a> the role of refactoring for software
      development, the nature of design changes we see, and how to break down
      big changes into small pieces.</p>
